<span style="font-family: inherit;">Shinzo Abe, Japan’s Prime Minister,
[has announced](http://www.the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001229901)
that Japan needs a more flexible working style without the ridiculously
long hours that prevent many women from working. This is a very laudable
goal and something that Japan will need in the face of a shrinking
population and many in the younger generation that seem
[reluctant](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2002/02/05/national/are-freeters-result-of-slump-source-of-next-one/)
to devote their lives to the company. (Typically, the photo accompanying
the article about improving working conditions for women shows a
committee that consists almost entirely of old men.) In fact, changes
are already happening, albeit very slowly. When I started working in
Japan 14 years ago many colleagues came into work on Saturdays and
nearly all stayed very late. Many still stay fairly late but the company
has prohibited Saturday working and is putting limits on overtime.
</span>


</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">What really worried me in the
[Yomiuri article](http://www.the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001229901)
though was the quote:

> <span style="font-family: inherit;">“I would like you to investigate a
> framework for a new working-hours system that befits work styles
> evaluated based on results, not time,” Abe said at the meeting.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">This sounds like Abe wants to
replace one dysfunctional system with a different but equally
dysfunctional one. A shift from the bureaucratic nightmare described by
[Northcote C. Parkinson](http://www.economist.com/node/14116121) to one
based on industrial age thinking.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">The Yomiuri article hints at the
problem by describing the “entrenched system of long working hours
suppressing productivity” and suggests limiting working hours as the
solution. However, the problem is in the working culture that equates
dedication to hours worked and working harder as the means to achieve
more. Changing this will be harder than just limiting overtime. Which is
probably where the focus on results comes from, companies worried about
their revenue probably want that to ensure nothing actually
changes.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">The suggestion in the article is
that employees could work whatever hours they like so long as they
achive the results. This sounds remarkably like management by objectives
which is strange from a country that so admired W. Edwards Demming who
had “[Eliminate managemement by
objective](http://www.industryweek.com/mbo-stifle)” as one of his 14
points for running a company. The problems with this approach are
legion. It discourages teamwork and it puts the focus on the individual
instead of the system as the source of productivity. It also assumes
that it is actually meaningful to measure “results” or productivity at
an individual level. </span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">To improve productivity it is
necessary focus on the system. Ironically it is Japanese companies such
as Toyota that have shown the world what can be achieved by doing this.
Yet Abe’s statement demonstrates that this is an exception, even in
Japan rather than the norm. I see this problem daily at my own
workplace. Long working hours are considered normal, this gives no
incentive to actually improve the working practice since you are going
to be in the office anyway. And even when there is a desire to improve
the system everyone is so busy dealing with what John Seddon calls
‘[failure demand](http://www.systemsthinking.co.uk/6-12.asp)’ that there
is no time to introduce improvements.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;">From the perspective of software
development this means that developers are so busy debugging the code
that they have no time to consider how those bugs got there in the first
place and what changes they could make to prevent them. “We don’t have
time to do unit testing or code review”. It is very hard for them to
change the system, so </span>simultaneously<span
style="font-family: inherit;"> making them responsible for their results
while limiting the only thing that they control, their working hours, is
both demotivating and unfair.</span>  
<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Update: </span><span
style="font-family: inherit;">A [nice
article](https://web.archive.org/web/20140720180458/http://wellbeing.vanguard-method.com/2014/04/29/immunised-against-improvement-part-2/)
from [Vangard](http://wellbeing.vanguard-method.com/) Consulting puts
the case against "management by results" in the health care sector very
clearly:</span>  

> Wherever management by results exists so too does the failure to
> accurately understand and sustainably solve systemic problems. This is
> in the nature of management by results because:  
>
> 1.  It wrongly assumes that performance can be adequately described by
>     a system of measurement; and
> 2.  It holds people and organisations to account for the fictions that
>     this creates.
