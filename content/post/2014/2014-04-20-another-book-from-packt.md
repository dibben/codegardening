Packt asked me to review another
[book](http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-reviewboard/book)
for them; this time on [Review Board.](http://www.reviewboard.org/) 
"Getting Started With Review Board" by Sandeep Rawat. Maybe they didn't
actually read my previous review of the QtCreator book. After I replied
that I would be happy to write an actual review, that would probably be
bad,  rather than just an endorsement I didn't hear back from them  
  
Review Board is a great tool. I have been using at work now for several
years. It is a free open source tool for code review. In the very early
days the setup required installing several packages but for several
versions now the setup/upgrade process has been made trivially easy. It
uses the python easy\_install tools so normally the install, including
all the pre-requisites can be done with a single command. It also has
great online help and installation instructions. It is also very easy to
use. I find that new users in my team just need a 5 minute explanation
of the main features and they are good to go.  
  
Which brings me to the Pack book. It is described on their web page as  

> <span
> style="background-color: white; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">This
> book is a concise, to-the-point guide with a practical walkthrough of
> the code review workflow using the features present in
> Reviewboard. </span>

Based on the table of contents and the sample chapter what this means is
that the book is simply a very short description of what reviewboard is.
The sample chapter on "Reviewing Code Review Requests" was simply a
description of the Review Board features that are not only easy to
figure out for yourself they are also described fully in the free help
with the program. The book will also be out of date very soon since
Review Board 2.0 is about to be released.  
  
So I don't really understand the point of this book. Why would anyone
want to spend $12  for the eBook or $22 for a paper book for something
that is not really needed and available for free online.  
  
What would actually be useful is a book on how to do code reviews. Karl
Wieigers "[Peer Reviews in Software: A Practical
Guide](https://www.blogger.com/Peer%20Reviews%20in%20Software:%20A%20Practical%20Guide)"
is one of the best books on the subject that I have found. [Smart
Bear](http://smartbear.com/) also have a [free
eBook](http://smartbear.com/resources/ebooks/) on code review available
(requires registration) which while obviously meant to advertise their
code review tool does discuss code review in general. However, there are
not so many books that cover code reviews.  
  
The publisher of the book is often a good indicator of the quality of
the book. Some publishers, like [The Pragmatic
Programmers](https://pragprog.com/) are always reliable.  I think I will
be avoiding Packt books in the future.
