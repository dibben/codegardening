[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10888391/link-fatal-error-lnk1123-failure-during-conversion-to-coff-file-invalid-or-c)
just rescued me again from yet another Microsoft problem. It seems if
you try to install Visual Studio 2012 when you already have a Visual
Studio 2010 installation then the 2010 installation gets broken.  
  
Fortunately MS have released a SP to 2010 which fixes the problem. But
it should not happen in the first place. Unless you do everything on a
virtual machine when you try a new program like VS2012 you will want to
keep your existing environment working. Did they not test installing
VS2012 onto a machine with VS2010? I can't believe that they did not,
which means that they must not care about breaking existing
environments. Â There was no warning message that it would happen and the
Update for 2010 was only available after installing 2012.
